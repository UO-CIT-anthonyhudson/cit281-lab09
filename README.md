## CIT 281 Lab 09

In this lab we:
- Create Learning Lab course/repo within your GitHub account
- Practice exiting and returning to the course from course repo
- Work through course

In this lab I went through the "Create a release based workflow" learning course through GitHub. It took about an hour.
